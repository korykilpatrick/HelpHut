# Project State Tracking

> **AI Agent Usage Guide**
> 1. Always read this file first when joining a conversation to understand project context
> 2. Update the "Last Updated" timestamp and description with EVERY change you make
> 3. Move completed items from "Recently Completed Changes" to appropriate status sections after 5+ new changes
> 4. Use checkboxes: [ ] todo, [x] done, [~] in progress
> 5. Keep "Recently Completed Changes" limited to last 5 items
> 6. Add important context/gotchas to "Notes for AI Assistant"
> 7. Always maintain relative paths from project root
> 8. If you make changes to the codebase, document them here

2. API route implementations pending
3. Service layer implementation needed

## Recently Completed Changes
1. Database types implementation completed
2. Database connection setup finished
3. Server route structure setup
4. Documentation endpoint mounting
5. Basic HTTP server creation

## Technical Debt & TODOs
1. Implement database types matching OpenAPI spec
2. Set up proper error handling
3. Add validation layer

## Dependencies & Infrastructure
- Express.js for server
- TypeScript configuration in place
- HTTP server basics configured

## Notes for AI Assistant
