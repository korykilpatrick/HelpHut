# HelpHut: Food Rescue Management System
> Connecting Austin's surplus food to those who need it most

## Product Overview

HelpHut is a specialized platform designed to help Austin nonprofits, food banks, and volunteers coordinate surplus food rescue and distribution. The system replaces fragmented communication channels with a unified platform, making it easy to track donations from submission to delivery while ensuring food reaches those in need before it spoils.

## Goals & Vision

Our platform aims to solve critical challenges in food rescue operations:

Eliminate Food Waste: Ensure perishable food moves quickly from donors to recipients through smart prioritization and tracking.

Centralize Communication: Replace scattered emails, calls, and texts with a single, organized system for all stakeholders.

Scale Operations: Support city-wide growth by connecting with existing tools and systems nonprofits already use.

Empower Self-Service: Give donors, volunteers, and partners the tools to manage their own activities with minimal administrative overhead.
